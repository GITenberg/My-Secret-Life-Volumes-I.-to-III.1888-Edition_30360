<h2>
    INTRODUCTION
</h2>
<p>
In 18&mdash; my oldest friend died. We had been at school and college
together, and our intimacy had never been broken. I was trustee for his
wife and executor at his death. He died of a lingering illness, during
which his hopes of living were alternately raised, and depressed. Two
years before he died, he gave me a huge parcel carefully tied up and
sealed. Take care of, but don't open this he said: if I get better,
return it to me, if I die, let no mortal eye but yours see it, and burn
it.
</p>
<p>
His widow died a year after him. I had well nigh forgoten this packet
which I had had full three years, when looking for some title deeds
I came cross it, and opened it, as it was my duty to do. Its contents
astonished me. The more I read it, the more marvellous it seemed. I
pondered long on the meaning of his instructions when he gave it to me,
and kept the manuscript some years, hesitating what to do with it.
</p>
<p>
At length I came to the conclusion knowing his idiosyncracy well, that
his fear was only lest any one should know who the writer was; and
feeling that it would be sinful to destroy such a history, I copied the
manuscript and destroyed the original. He died relationless.
</p>
<p>
No one now can trace the author, no names are mentioned in the book,
though they were given freely in the margin of his manuscript, and I
alone know to whom the initials refer. If I have done harm in printing
it, I have done none to him, have indeed only carried out his evident
intention, and given to a few a secret history, which bears the impress
of truth on every page, a contribution to psychology.

<h2>
    PREFACE
</h2>
<p>
I began these memoirs when about twenty-five years old, having from
youth kept a diary of some sort, which perhaps from habit made me think
of recording my inner and secret life.
</p>
<p>
When I began it, I had scarcely read a baudy book, none of which
excepting "Fanny Hill" appeared to me to be truthful, that did, and
it does so still; the others telling of recherche eroticisms, or
of inordinate copulative powers, of the strange twists, tricks, and
fancies, of matured voluptuousness, and philosophical lewedness, seemed
to my comparative ignorance, as baudy imaginings, or lying inventions,
not worthy of belief; although I now know by experience, that they may
be true enough, however eccentric, and improbable, they may appear to
the uninitiated.
</p>
<p>
Fanny Hill was a woman's experience. Written perhaps by a woman, where
was a man's, written with equal truth? That book has no baudy word
in it; but baudy acts need the baudy ejaculations; the erotic, full
flavored expressions, which even the chastest indulge in, when lust, or
love, is in its full tide of performance. So I determined to write my
private life freely as to fact, and in the spirit of the lustful acts
done by me, or witnessed; it is written therefore with absolute truth,
and without any regard whatever for what the world calls decency.
Decency and voluptuousness in its fullest acceptance, cannot exist
together, one would kill the other; the poetry of copulation I have only
experienced with a few women, which however neither prevented them, nor
me from calling a spade, a spade.
</p>
<p>
I began it for my amusement; when many years had been chronicled I tired
of it and ceased. Some ten years afterwards I met a woman, with whom,
or with those she helped me do; I did, said, saw, and heard, well nigh
everything a man and woman could do with their genitals, and began to
narrate those events, when quite fresh in my memory, a great variety of
incidents extending over four years or more. Then I lost sight of her,
and my amorous amusements for a while were simpler, but that part of my
history was complete.
</p>
<p>
After a little while, I set to work to describe the events of the
intervening years of my youth, and early middle age; which included most
of my gallant intrigues and adventures of a frisky order; but not the
more lascivious ones of later years. Then an illness caused me to think
seriously of burning the whole. But not liking to destroy my labor, I
laid it aside again for a couple of years. Then another illness gave
me long uninterrupted leisure; I read my manuscript, and filled in some
occurrences which I had forgotten, but which my diary enabled me to
place in their proper order. This will account for the difference in
style in places, which I now observe; and a very needless repetition,
of voluptuous descriptions, which I had forgotten, had been before
described; that however is inevitable, for human copulation, vary the
incidents leading up to it as you may, is, and must be, at all times,
much the same affair.
</p>
<p>
Then for the first time, I thought I would print my work that had been
commenced more than twenty years before, but hesitated. I then had
entered my maturity, and on to the most lascivious portion of my life,
the events were disjointed, and fragmentary and my amusement was to
describe them just after they occurred. Most frequently the next day I
wrote all down with much prolixity, since, I have much abbreviated it.
</p>
<p>
I had from youth an excellent memory, but about sexual matters a
wonderful one. Women were the pleasure of my life. I loved cunt, but
also she who had it; I like the woman I fucked and not simply the cunt
I fucked, and therein is a great difference. I recollect even now in a
degree which astonishes me, the face, color, stature, thighs, backside,
and cunt, of well nigh every woman I have had, who was not a mere
casual; and even of some who were. The clothes they wore, the houses and
rooms in which I had them, were before me mentally, as I wrote, the way
the bed, and furniture were placed, the side of the room the windows
were on, I remembered perfectly; and all the important events I can fix
as to time, sufficiently nearly by reference to my diary, in which the
contemporaneous circumstances of my life are recorded.
</p>
<p>
I recollect also largely what we said, and did, and generally our baudy
amusements. Where I fail to have done so, I have left description blank,
rather than attempt to make a story coherent by inserting what was
merely probable. I could not now account for my course of action, nor
why I did this, or said that, my conduct seems strange, foolish, absurd,
very frequently, that of some women, equally so, but I can but state
what did occur.
</p>
<p>
In a few cases, I have for what even seems to me very strange, suggested
reasons, or causes, but only where the facts seem by themselves to be
very improbable, but have not exaggerated anything willingly. When I
have named the number of times I have fucked a woman in my youth, I may
occasionally be in error, it is difficult to be quite accurate on such
points after a lapse of time. But as before said in many cases the
incidents were written down a few weeks and often within a few
days after they occurred. I do not attempt to pose as a Hercules in
copulation, there are quite sufficient braggarts on that head, much
intercourse with gay women, and doctors, makes me doubt the wonderful
feats in coition, some men tell of.
</p>
<p>
I have one fear about publicity, it is that of having done a few things
by curiosity and impulse (temporary abberations), which even professed
libertines may cry fie on. There are plenty who will cry fie who have
done all and worse than I have and habitually, but crying out at the
sins of others was always a way of hiding one's own iniquity. Yet from
that cause perhaps no mortal eye but mine, will see this history. The
christian name of the servants mentioned are generally the true ones,
the other names mostly false, the phonetically resembling the true
ones. Initials nearly always the true ones. In most cases the woman they
represent are dead or lost to me. Streets and baudy houses named are
nearly always correct. Most of the houses named are now closed or pulled
down; but any middle aged man about town would recognize them. Where a
road, house, room, or garden is described, the description is exactly
true; even to the situation of a tree, chair, bed, sofa, pisspot. The
district is sometimes given wrongly; but it matters little whether
Brompton be substituted for Hackney, or Camden Town for Walworth. Where
however owing to the incidents it is needful, the places of amusement
are given correctly. The Tower, and Argyle rooms, for example. All this
is done to prevent giving pain to some, perhaps still living, for I have
no malice to gratify.
</p>
<p>
I have mystified family affairs, but if I say I had ten cousins, when I
had but six, or that one aunt's house was in Surrey instead of Kent, or
in Lancashire; it breaks the clue and cannot matter to the reader.
</p>
<p>
But my doings with man and woman are as true as gospel. If I say that
I saw, or did, that with a cousin male, or female, it was with a cousin
and no mere acquaintance; if with a servant, it was with a servant; if
with a casual acquaintance, it is equally true. Nor if I say I had that
woman, and did this or that with her, or felt or did aught else with a
man, is there a word of untruth excepting as to the place at which the
incidents occurred. But even those are mostly correctly given, this is
intended to be a true history, and not a lie.

<h2>
    SECOND PREFACE
</h2>
<p>
Some years have passed away since I penned the foregoing, and it is not
printed. I have since gone through abnormal phases of amatory life, have
done and seen things, had tastes and letches which years ago I thought
were the dreams of erotic mad-men; these are all described, the
manuscript has grown into unmanageable bulk, shall it, can it be
printed? What will be said or thought of me, what become of the
manuscript if found when I am dead, better to destroy the whole, it has
fulfilled its purpose in amusing me, now let it go to the flames!
</p>
<p>
I have read my manuscript, through what reminiscences I had actually
forgotten some of the early ones; how true the detail strikes me as I
read of my early experiences; had it not been written then, it never
could have been written now, has anybody but myself faithfully made such
a record? It would be a sin to burn all this, whatever society may
say it is but a narrative of human life, perhaps the every day life of
thousands, if the confession could be had.
</p>
<p>
What strikes me as curious in reading it, is the monotony of the course
I have pursued toward women who were not of the gay class; it has been
as similar, and repetitive as fucking itself; do all men act so, does
every man kiss, coax, hint smuttily, then talk baudily, snatch a feel,
smell his fingers, assault, and win, exactly as I have done? Is every
woman offended, say no, then oh! blush, be angry, refuse, close her
thighs, after a struggle open them, and yield to her lust as mine have
done? A conclave of whores telling the truth, and of Romish Priests,
could alone settle the point. Have all men had the strange letches which
late in life have enraptured me, though in early days the idea of them
revolted me? I can never know this, my experience if printed may enable
others to compare as I cannot.
</p>
<p>
Shall it be burnt or printed? How many years have passed in this
indecision, why fear; it is for others' good and not my own if
preserved.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
